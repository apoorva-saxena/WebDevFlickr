## Other info

- Think about how you might improve the speed of the page in terms of the images/content loading.
  We can host the images and other static assets on a cdn to speed up the loading time. 
- A search functionality based on tags, or possibly the title of the photo.
  Added search functionality which allows searching by title / description.
- Alternatively if you can think of any other features that you feel would further enhance your app, then we'd love to see what you can come up with!
  Have hosted it on heroku. We can add more features like allowing user accounts and allowing the ability to favourite an image.
